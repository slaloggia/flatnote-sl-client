# FlatNote 

## Description
Flatnote is an app that lets users create and maintain a list of notes. After creating a note, users can edit, add tags, and delete. Notes can be filtered by tags.

This was built as part of the Flatiron School Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.

## Technologies
- Built with React
- Styled with Semantic UI React
- Local store management with Redux
- Asynchronous actions handled with Thunk

## Backend
Before starting this front-end application, clone the [back-end app](https://github.com/slaloggia/flatnote-sl-backend), and follow the setup instructions.

## Run:
Once the backend server is running, run the following commands: 

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Using the app

Simply log in with whatever username you choose. This project focused on React & Redux and does not authenticate users,
however if you have logged in with the same username previously, your information will persist.
